You're in charge of developing currency exchanger in a special way.
There is a significant extra amount of 500, 20 and 2 nominal values
therefore the strategy is to first use those nominals and only then what is left
(for example 601 = 500 + 20 x5 +1; 999 = 500 + 20 x 29 + 2 Â£ 9 + 1) Design such a system
